WELCOME TO A BRAND NEW PYTHON PROJECT I HAVE DECIDED TO START ON MY OWN AS A FUN HOBBY.
THIS PROJECT WILL TEST MY ABILITY AS WELL AS PYTHONS (HOPEFULLY) IN HOW MUCH I CAN CRAME INTO 1 TINY PROGRAM!


-------------FIRST PUBLIC REPO-------------


WEATHER APP

You just enter a city i need to implement a way that the program can determine which true city you are attempting to get so it doesn't request the wrong information from the API


WIFI SPEED TESTER

Alright this is starting to get a bit much, i am probably going to update the code and logic shortly as atm i just craming everything into 1 file and its starting 
to make my head go turnmoil! 

Add new dark and light mode function as well as setting to the program!


(This code is open source!)
